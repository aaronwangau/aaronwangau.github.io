    </summary>
    <p>A globally minded student whose passion bridges **human-centered care, health science, and practical application**.</p>
    <p>My early cross-cultural experiences nurtured adaptability and open thinking, while my growing interest in **life sciences and systematic care** has connected my love of logic, empathy, and practical engagement.</p>
    <p>I aspire to study Nursing—not only to acquire specialized medical knowledge and skills, but also to understand and practice how science and compassion can provide individuals with **warm, dignified health support**.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Global Experiences & Curiosity for Discovery</h2>
    </summary>
    <p>In Grade 3, I accompanied my father—then a visiting scholar at the University of Wollongong—and studied Year 4 at Keiraville Public School in Australia.</p>
    <p>That experience opened my eyes to how people, ideas, and systems connect across cultures. It inspired a lasting curiosity about how the world works—specifically regarding **human interaction, life health**, and a genuine appreciation for discovery.</p>
    <p>Outside the classroom, I enjoyed tennis, football, cross-country, swimming, and surfing. Surfing and swimming especially taught me focus, persistence, and balance—qualities that continue to guide both my studies and my life, particularly the ability to remain calm under pressure.</p>

      <div class="detail-content">
        <p>Mathematics and systematic thinking have always been my strengths. In Australia, I was often drawn to exploring how logic could solve real problems. In China, I developed strong performance in English and Chinese, ranking 10th out of 500 students. After moving to Canada, I adapted quickly to a new academic environment, maintaining an average of 94% in Grade 11 while taking AP Physics 2 (4), as well as achieving an IELTS score of 8.5 overall (Listening and Reading: 9.0). Beyond school, I attended summer programs and continued self-learning in data and computing. I am working on another two AP courses now.</p>

      <summary>Community Clinic & Health Data Analysis Project – Exploring Care and Preventative Medicine (Click to Expand)</summary>
      <div class="detail-content">
        <p>While volunteering at a local community clinic, I developed a strong interest in foundational patient care and health promotion. Guided by healthcare professionals, I learned the importance of patient health management and preventative medicine. To merge my technical interest with health applications, I initiated a project focused on analyzing and organizing gene-related health datasets. By developing **automated data-processing workflows**, I aim to provide patients and the community with more accessible **health risk assessments and preventative information query services**. This project blends human care with technological innovation, with the goal of helping more people care for their health, prevent disease, and contribute to the future **automation and efficiency of the healthcare system**. These practical experiences have reinforced my commitment to pursuing a modern and professional path in Nursing.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Athletics & Endurance</h2>
    </summary>
    <p>I have loved water since I was two years old. Playing in swimming pools gave me endless joy and gradually built both skill and confidence. In kindergarten, I was selected by Coach Wu Ying, a championship coach from Chen Jinglun Youth Swimming Team, and began six years of semi-professional training. Although I chose not to pursue competitive swimming as a career, the discipline and endurance I developed have shaped my approach to learning and life, particularly the ability to maintain focus in high-pressure situations—a quality vital for future nursing work.</p>
    <p>In Australia, I swam in the ocean almost every day—one session for swimming, another for surfing. I received multiple awards at school swimming carnivals and was invited to the Illawarra Regional Championships. After returning to China, I joined the school basketball and orienteering teams, earning medals in track and field events. Now in Canada, I play badminton nearly every day and continue swimming weekly. Sports have brought me health, friendships, and the joy of teamwork—values that carry into all areas of my life, helping me understand the importance of **healthy lifestyles and collaborative efforts**.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Music, Reflection, and Creativity</h2>
    </summary>
    <p>Music has always been more than a practice—it has been a source of calm, reflection, and happiness. Learning the violin taught me patience, focus, and the beauty of detail. Even though I paused formal training, I hope to return to it in the future. Music continues to inspire how I think, imagine, and create—it helps me to **listen better, empathize**, and find inner balance in potentially stressful environments.</p>
